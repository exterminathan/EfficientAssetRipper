# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.7] - 2026-05-06

Unpacker performance and ergonomics: type-cache-backed asset filtering,
visual type indicators, and dropdown polish.

### Added
- Type cache + heuristic scan — asset-type filter resolves without
  re-walking the archive, large trees stay responsive.
- Visual type indicators on Unpacker rows (mesh / texture / audio / etc.).

### Changed
- Headless test suite — Qt tests run with no visible windows.

### Fixed
- Unpacker filter dropdowns no longer get stuck or mismatch their state.

## [0.8.6] - 2026-05-05

Mesh preview tab plus type-aware right-click previews across the Unpacker
and PSK Picker.

### Added
- 3D Mesh Preview tab — full 360° orbit, see-through wireframe, fast load.
- Right-click "Preview Mesh / Texture / Audio / Properties" in the Unpacker;
  unexpanded `.uasset` rows offer all kinds, expanded rows show only the
  preview buttons matching their contained types.
- Right-click "Preview Mesh" + "Open containing folder" in the PSK Picker.
- Auto-detect UE version from the game executable's `FileVersionInfo`.

### Changed
- More descriptive preview-failure status — "This asset has no <kind> data
  to preview" instead of "file exported but file not found".
- Optional dependencies cleanup and minor UI polish.

### Fixed
- First mesh preview no longer fails with a stale "file not found" — the
  resolver rescans the temp dir for both flat and nested CLI layouts.
- Mesh previewer: UV-grid crash and wireframe leak between loads.
- Build script clears stale .NET artifacts before publishing CUE4ParseCLI.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-05-05

Resilience and UX pass on top of v0.8.0. Full notes:
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md),
[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

### Added
- Queue checkpoint + startup resume prompt for interrupted batches.
- Crash reporter writes redacted JSON under `logs/` with a one-click
  "Open GitHub issue" path.
- Color Scheme dialog: live preview toggle and Reset to Default.
- Settings dialog: Restore Defaults button.
- Synthetic end-to-end pipeline test in CI (no external binaries).

### Changed
- Defensive profile loading — corrupt JSON is quarantined to
  `<name>.json.corrupt-<ts>` and the GUI keeps running.
- "Set the game folder in Settings" prompts now point at Manage Profiles.
- Architecture / troubleshooting / release notes moved into `docs/`.

### Fixed
- Theme-aware alert banner and swatch borders pick contrast from the
  active scheme instead of hardcoded values.
- Long asset paths in the detail dialog wrap and are selectable.
- Several minor cleanups: dead `_terminate_then_kill` removed, duplicate
  `QGroupBox` import dropped, hot-loop status-color lookup hoisted.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-04

Pre-1.0 hardening release. Sweeping security, reliability, and UX pass across
the GUI, Blender pipeline, CUE4ParseCLI, and the CI/release chain.

### Added
- **Manage Profiles dialog** — per-profile game/output/unpack paths, AES keys,
  mappings, and UE version live in a dedicated dropdown + editor instead of the
  global Settings panel.
- **Custom color scheme editor** with live swatches alongside the four built-in
  themes.
- **Release verification** — every ZIP ships `SHA256SUMS` and a signed
  build-provenance attestation; release notes embed `sha256sum --check` and
  `gh attestation verify` snippets.
- **Setup wizard** reachable from the Help menu (previously first-run only).
- **CHANGELOG enforcement** — release workflow refuses to publish a tag without
  a matching changelog block.
- **CUE4ParseCLI `--help` / `-h` / `/?`** usage banner.
- **Per-run nonce protocol** — Blender stdout is only trusted on
  `##ASSET_STATUS:<nonce>##` lines so unrelated output can't masquerade as
  status. Mirrored in the blend combiner.
- **Test coverage** grew from ~250 to ~470 tests across unit / integration / Qt
  tiers; new e2e smoke suite for the real CUE4ParseCLI binary under
  [tests/e2e/](tests/e2e/).

### Changed
- **Profile bar** collapsed to a dropdown plus a single Manage Profiles button.
  Unpacker-tab edits no longer leak back into the saved profile unless
  `auto_save_paths` is set.
- **PathPicker** widget hoisted into [gui/widgets.py](gui/widgets.py) for
  consistent path field UX.
- **Filter rebuilds** in PSK picker, asset browser, and text viewer are
  debounced — 40k-asset folders stay responsive while typing.
- **Audio and image previewers** decode and `rmtree` on `QThreadPool` with
  token-based invalidation so stale loads can't overwrite the active selection.
- **Texture classifier** uses longest-suffix-wins with `priority_order` from
  the preset JSON breaking ties — `_OR` can no longer shadow `_ORM`.
- **Material parent chain** capped at depth 32; case-mixed cycles terminate.
- **Closest-path tiebreaker** deterministic (path-len, then lower-cased
  string), insulating picks from candidate-list shuffles.
- **Scan cache** version mismatches archived to `scan_*.json.bak.<ts>`; backups
  older than 30 days pruned on launch.
- **Processed-state auto-detect** symmetric — deleting a `.blend` flips state
  back to False on the next load.
- **JobManager** terminates the live Blender subprocess on cancel and emits
  `asset_updated(idx, state_dict)` for GUI-thread state application instead of
  cross-thread mutation.
- **MainWindow** tracks worker threads, drains them on close, and writes scan
  caches off-thread.
- **`build.bat`** runs the fast test tiers as step `[0b/5]` and aborts on
  failure; CI builds fail if the CLI cannot be built or `version_info.txt`
  generation errors out.
- **`build_cli.bat`** uses `--self-contained true` + `PublishSingleFile` so
  dev rebuilds match the shipped artifact.
- **`sync.ps1`** restore is non-destructive; backup additive unless `-Force`.
- **Dependabot** collapsed to a single weekly grouped PR for GitHub Actions
  updates.
- **CI actions** pinned to full SHA + version; default permissions
  `contents: read`, write scopes opted into per-job.
- **`PY_PYTHON=3.11`** pinned in CI so the `py` launcher doesn't pick the
  runner's 3.14 (no PySide6 wheels). PySide6 upper bound bumped to `<7.0`.

### Fixed
- Alert banner colors and swatch borders now follow the active scheme.
- Long asset paths wrap and are selectable instead of clipping.
- Blender pipe-drain failures are logged instead of swallowed.
- Settings dialog validates path-typed fields before save, clamps the timeout,
  and opens presets via `QDesktopServices`.
- `Theme.apply` skips no-op reapplies and only registers fonts once per process.
- Splash always closes even if the finish callback throws.
- Detail dialogs use `WA_DeleteOnClose`; menu actions gain `&`-mnemonics and
  standard shortcut keys.
- PSK `MATT` chunk parser bound-checks dims, returns `(names, ok)` so corrupt
  PSKs surface as `scan_failed`, and falls back utf-8 / cp1252 / ascii on
  material name decode.
- [blender/material_setup.py](blender/material_setup.py) uses named mix-node
  sockets and a `BSDF_RENAMES` table for Blender 4.x socket names
  (Subsurface / Specular / Transmission / Sheen / Clearcoat).
- [blender/process_asset.py](blender/process_asset.py) treats `CANCELLED` and
  "no mesh produced" as hard failures; `.blend` save is atomic (tmp file →
  `os.replace`) with a non-zero size check.
- [blender/combine_blends.py](blender/combine_blends.py) refuses to save when
  nothing was appended.
- [core/props_parser.py](core/props_parser.py) reads `utf-8-sig`, parses RGBA
  in any order, logs JSON errors with lineno/msg.
- `build.bat` parens inside `if (...)` blocks escaped — fixes the
  `was unexpected at this time.` abort at step `[3/5]`.
- `test_validate_re_runs_when_mtime_changes` flake — explicit `os.utime` bump
  instead of relying on two consecutive `write_bytes` calls landing in distinct
  NTFS mtime ticks. Was the sole cause of the recent CI test-gate failures.

### Security
- **Path traversal** — `ProfileManager` CRUD routes through `_safe_path`,
  blocking `..\`, reserved Windows device names, and inputs that resolve
  outside `profiles/`. CUE4ParseCLI gains `SafeJoin()` at every write site
  (mesh / texture / anim / props / Wwise audio).
- **DLL planting** — `Everything64.dll` loader requires an absolute path and
  passes `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32`; bare filenames rejected.
- **Secret redaction** — new [core/log_redaction.py](core/log_redaction.py)
  masks `key` / `aes` / `password` / `token` / `secret` fields and inline hex
  blobs ≥ 32 chars across the root logger, the Blender cmd/stderr surface, and
  job log entries.
- **AES error messages** no longer echo raw bytes.
- **Update check** — GitHub responses capped at 64 KB, `tag_name`
  shape-validated, off-host redirects refused, non-`github.com` release URLs
  stripped before render.
- **NDJSON DoS** — CUE4ParseCLI child killed if its stdout buffer exceeds
  16 MB without a newline.
- **Blender identity probe** — `--version` checked once per session; refuses
  to spawn the render subprocess if the banner isn't Blender. Manifest
  allowlist (psk extension, absolute output path, `.blend` suffix,
  outputs-root containment, image-extension texture paths) enforced both
  Python-side and Blender-side.
- **Supply chain** — Oodle and vgmstream downloads pinned to tag + SHA-256;
  per-entry zip extraction blocks zip-slip.
- **vgmstream invocation** uses `ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList`, eliminating
  the prior shell-quoting injection surface.
- **Newtonsoft** pinned to `TypeNameHandling.None`.
- **Stdin oversize cap** — 4 MB per-line limit on CUE4ParseCLI.
- **Release tag** must be an ancestor of `origin/main` before publish.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-26

Initial public beta release.

### Added
- **Asset Scanner** with [Everything SDK](https://www.voidtools.com/) for
  instant search across game directories.
- **Material Resolver** — parses `.props.txt` metadata, follows material
  inheritance chains, classifies textures by PBR slot (Base Color, Normal,
  ORM, Emissive, Roughness, Metallic, Mask).
- **Headless Blender pipeline** — imports PSK/PSKX, builds full PBR shader
  node graphs, saves `.blend` files. Reuses bundled `io_scene_psk_psa`
  extension.
- **VFS Unpacker** — built-in CUE4Parse CLI mounts `.pak`/`.utoc` archives
  with AES decryption and exports meshes, textures, animations, and audio.
- **Batch processing queue** with progress tracking, logging, and cancel.
- **Per-game profiles** for game folder, AES keys, UE version, and processed
  asset lists.
- **Texture preset system** with per-material overrides
  ([data/texture_presets.json](data/texture_presets.json)).
- **WWise audio support** — scans `AkAudioEvent` assets, exports WEM, and
  converts to WAV/OGG via vgmstream.
- **Blend Combiner** — merge multiple `.blend` files into a single grid
  scene.
- **First-run setup wizard** with auto-detection for Blender, Everything,
  and the .NET runtime.
- **Auto-update check** against the GitHub Releases API on startup
  (cached for 24 hours, fails silently when offline).
- **Themeable UI** — 4 built-in colour schemes (Dusk, Bloom, Slate,
  Midnight) plus a custom scheme editor.
- **PyInstaller `--onedir` build** producing a portable
  `EfficientAssetRipper-win-x64.zip`.
- **CI/CD** — GitHub Actions workflows for PR/main builds and tag-driven
  releases.
- **Test suite** — pytest unit / integration / Qt tiers (~8s),
  plus opt-in `requires_blender` / `requires_everything` /
  `requires_dotnet_cli` e2e markers.
- **MIT License** and legal disclaimer for asset extraction usage.
