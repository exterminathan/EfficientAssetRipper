# Architecture

This document captures the architectural shape of EfficientAssetRipper —
the parts that aren't obvious from a single file read. Read [README.md](../README.md)
first for the user-facing pitch, then come back here when you need to make
non-trivial changes.

## What this is

A PySide6 desktop app (Windows-first) that turns Unreal Engine 5 game files
into ready-to-use Blender `.blend` scenes. Pipeline:
**Unpack** (`.pak`/`.utoc` → loose files) → **Scan** (find PSK/PSKX) →
**Resolve** (parse `.props.txt` for materials/textures) →
**Process** (headless Blender wires PBR shader graphs and saves `.blend`).

Two big subsystems live in one repo:

- **Python GUI + orchestration** (PySide6 / Qt6).
- **CUE4ParseCLI** — a separate .NET 8.0 project that does all UE archive
  parsing/extraction, talking to the GUI over NDJSON on stdio.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| [main.py](../main.py) | App entry. Builds icon, applies theme, runs splash, shows [gui/main_window.py](../gui/main_window.py). |
| [_base.py](../_base.py) | `base_dir()` — resolves project root for both source and frozen PyInstaller exe. **Use this everywhere — never hardcode paths.** |
| [config.py](../config.py) | Thin wrapper over `QSettings` (registry: `HKCU\Software\EfficientAssetRipper`). Defaults defined in `_DEFAULTS`. Per-game data lives in `profiles/`, not here. |
| [core/](../core/) | Headless backend logic. No Qt widgets, but Qt signals/threads are OK. |
| [gui/](../gui/) | All PySide6 UI. Imports from `core/`, never the reverse. |
| [blender/](../blender/) | Scripts run **inside** Blender as a subprocess (`blender --background --python ...`). They `import bpy` — do NOT import from `core/` or `gui/`. |
| [cue4parse_cli/](../cue4parse_cli/) | .NET 8.0 single-file CLI, embeds CUE4Parse + Newtonsoft.Json. The Python side never reads `.pak` directly. |
| [data/texture_presets.json](../data/texture_presets.json) | Texture-suffix → PBR-slot rules and per-material overrides. Single source of truth for wiring decisions. |
| [profiles/](../profiles/) | Per-game JSON (gitignored). Has `game_dir`, `aes_keys`, `ue_version`, `psk_processed`, etc. |
| [cache/](../cache/), [outputs/](../outputs/), [logs/](../logs/) | Gitignored runtime data. `cache/scan_<md5>.json` keyed by game folder hash. `cache/queue_checkpoint.json` survives interrupted batches. |
| [build.bat](../build.bat) | PyInstaller `--onedir` build that also dotnet-publishes the CLI and zips everything. |
| [sync.ps1](../sync.ps1) | Robocopy of gitignored `profiles/`/`cache/` to a backup target via `$env:EAR_SYNC_PATH`. Don't auto-run. |

## Architectural rules

1. **`core/` ↔ `gui/`**: `gui` imports `core`, never the reverse. Long work
   in `core/` runs in a `QThread` (`ScanWorker`, `RescanWorker`,
   `JobManager`) and reports back via Qt signals.
2. **All paths go through `base_dir()`** from [_base.py](../_base.py).
   PyInstaller frozen exes put data files next to the .exe; source runs
   use the repo root. Hardcoded absolute paths break the build.
3. **Blender scripts are isolated.** [blender/process_asset.py](../blender/process_asset.py)
   and [blender/material_setup.py](../blender/material_setup.py) only see
   `bpy` + a JSON manifest. They communicate **back** by printing
   `##ASSET_STATUS##{...json...}` lines, parsed in
   [core/blender_runner.py](../core/blender_runner.py).
4. **CUE4ParseCLI IPC is NDJSON over stdio.** [core/unpacker.py](../core/unpacker.py)
   wraps it as a `QObject` with signals. Every line is one JSON object.
   - Commands: `init`, `browse`, `export`, `export_folder`, `cancel`,
     `get_props`, `scan_wwise_events`, `list_exports`, `export_wwise_audio`,
     `quit`.
   - Reply types: `init_done`, `browse_result`, `progress`, `export_done`,
     `props_result`, `exports_listed`, `wwise_scan_result`, `warning`,
     `version_warning`, `error`, `cancelled`, `quit_ack`.
5. **Asset resolution is suffix-driven, not path-driven.**
   [core/texture_resolver.py](../core/texture_resolver.py) classifies
   textures by suffix (`_C`, `_N`, `_ORM`, …) first, then `param_names`
   from props as fallback. Material overrides in `texture_presets.json`
   can force specific textures into specific slots.
6. **Material parent chains are followed.** A material with no textures
   of its own walks `parent_name` upward via
   [`_resolve_parent_chain`](../core/asset_scanner.py), merging color
   tints / scalar params child-overrides-parent.
7. **Scan results are cached per game folder.** Cache file is
   `cache/scan_<md5(game_folder)>.json`, version-tagged
   (`_CACHE_VERSION`). On scan, already-cached PSK paths with
   `mesh_props_found=True` are reused.
8. **Profile vs global settings.** Keys in
   `core/profile_manager.PROFILE_KEYS` belong to the active profile JSON;
   everything else lives in QSettings. Switching profiles re-reads the
   per-game state. `migrate_from_qsettings` runs on first launch to seed
   a `Default` profile.
9. **Defensive profile loading.** Corrupt JSON is renamed to
   `<name>.json.corrupt-<ts>` and the loader returns empty defaults so a
   single bad profile cannot brick the launcher.
   `ProfileLoadError` distinguishes OS-level read failures (file locked,
   permission denied) from "missing" / "corrupt" cases.
10. **Crash reporting.** [core/crash_reporter.py](../core/crash_reporter.py)
    installs `sys.excepthook` + `qInstallMessageHandler` and writes
    redacted JSON reports to `logs/crash_*.json`. The reporter offers a
    pre-filled GitHub issue URL but never phones home automatically.
11. **Queue resume.** `JobManager` writes `cache/queue_checkpoint.json`
    after every job (success or fail). Cancelled batches keep the file;
    clean finishes drop it. On startup the main window prompts to resume
    when a checkpoint matches the active profile.

## CUE4ParseCLI rebuild

The repo has at times lived on cloud-synced folders; .NET file locks broke
`dotnet publish` in-place. Build into temp first, then copy back:

```powershell
dotnet publish cue4parse_cli/CUE4ParseCLI.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 `
  --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true `
  -o "$env:TEMP\CUE4ParseCLI_build"
# then copy $env:TEMP\CUE4ParseCLI_build\* → cue4parse_cli/bin/publish/
```

`build.bat` does this same thing (with a non-self-contained variant).
After editing anything in `cue4parse_cli/`, rebuild before declaring the
change done — the Python side loads the published exe at runtime, not the
source.

## External dependencies (runtime, not pip)

- **Everything** desktop app **must be running** —
  [core/everything.py](../core/everything.py) is a ctypes wrapper around
  `Everything64.dll`. No Everything = no scan. There is no fallback.
- **Blender 4.0+** — `bpy.ops.psk.import_file` from the bundled
  `io_scene_psk_psa` extension is the default importer (configurable via
  `psk_addon_name` setting).
- **.NET 8.0 Runtime** — to run CUE4ParseCLI.exe.
- **Oodle / vgmstream** — auto-downloaded by CUE4ParseCLI when first
  needed.

## Common gotchas

- **PSK material extraction fallback.** When a mesh `.props.txt` lists no
  materials, `_extract_psk_materials` in [core/asset_scanner.py](../core/asset_scanner.py)
  reads names from the binary `MATT0000` chunk. Don't remove this — some
  exports lack material refs in props.
- **Closest-path tiebreaker.** When Everything returns multiple matches
  for the same texture/material name, `_pick_closest_path` in
  [core/texture_resolver.py](../core/texture_resolver.py) picks the
  candidate sharing the longest path prefix with the source PSK. Critical
  for games that ship duplicate names across folders.
- **Scene reset in Blender.** [blender/process_asset.py](../blender/process_asset.py)
  manually clears `bpy.data.objects/meshes/materials/images/armatures`
  rather than `read_factory_settings` — the latter wipes the extension
  system and breaks the PSK addon. Don't "simplify" this.
- **Status parsing requires the `##ASSET_STATUS##` prefix** — anything
  else on stdout is treated as plain Blender output.
- **AppUserModelID** is set in [main.py](../main.py) so the Windows
  taskbar shows the gem icon instead of a generic Python interpreter
  icon.
- **`creationflags=CREATE_NO_WINDOW`** in
  [core/blender_runner.py](../core/blender_runner.py) — without it
  Blender flashes a console window on Windows.

## Conventions

- Type-annotated, `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of
  `core/` modules.
- Dataclasses for plain records (`AssetEntry`, `MaterialEntry`,
  `ResolvedTexture`, `BlenderResult`, `MeshProps`, `MaterialProps`).
- Logging via `log = logging.getLogger(__name__)` — no `print` in
  `core/` / `gui/`. Blender scripts can print (the runner reads stdout).
- Comments are sparse and explain *why*. Match the existing style — don't
  add WHAT-comments.
- Color schemes: 4 built-in (`Dusk`, `Bloom`, `Slate`, `Midnight`) plus
  user-defined. Theme is applied centrally via [gui/theme.py](../gui/theme.py);
  never hardcode colors in widgets — pull from `theme.current_scheme()`.

## Test suite

A tiered pytest suite lives in [tests/](../tests/). Install dev deps once:

```bash
py -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Tiers and speed:**

| Command | Time | What it covers |
|---------|------|----------------|
| `py -m pytest tests/unit` | ~0.5s | Pure logic — parsers, classifier, resolver, scanner serialization, ctypes mocks |
| `py -m pytest tests/integration` | ~0.5s | Real fixtures + disk I/O — profile CRUD, scan cache, resolver, queue checkpoint |
| `py -m pytest tests/qt` | ~10s | PySide6 widgets via pytest-qt — all panels, signals, StubQProcess, synthetic e2e pipeline |
| `py -m pytest` | ~12s | All three tiers above |
| `py -m pytest -m requires_blender` | opt-in | Needs `BLENDER_EXE` env var |
| `py -m pytest -m requires_dotnet_cli` | opt-in | Needs `CUE4PARSE_CLI` env var |
| `py -m pytest -m requires_everything` | opt-in | Needs `EVERYTHING_DLL` env var |

**Pre-build gate:** `build.bat` runs the fast tiers as step `[0b/5]` and
aborts on any failure. Opt-in e2e markers are excluded from the gate.

**Key fixtures** (all in [tests/conftest.py](../tests/conftest.py)):

| Fixture | What it provides |
|---------|-----------------|
| `FakeEverythingSDK` | Ctypes-free SDK stand-in; seed with `make_fake_sdk(file_index)` |
| `mock_qsettings` | Dict-backed QSettings stub; avoids touching the real Windows registry |
| `tmp_profiles_dir` | Monkeypatches `_PROFILES_DIR` to `tmp_path` for isolated profile CRUD |
| `mock_blender_run` | Patches `run_blender` at both import sites; returns a canned `BlenderResult`. Set `write_dummy_blend_on_success` for the synthetic e2e path |
| `jedi_scan_dict` | Loads `cache/scan_b6df0cbbd18d.json` once per session (skips if absent) |

The `tests/qt/` tier auto-isolates `core.queue_checkpoint` to the test's
`tmp_path` so JobManager runs don't write to the real cache directory.

**Adding a test:**

- **Unit** — pure function + fixture, no I/O, no Qt. Put it in
  `tests/unit/core/` mirroring the source path.
- **Integration** — needs disk or `FakeEverythingSDK`. Use
  `make_fake_sdk` + `tiny_presets` or `real_presets` for resolver tests.
- **Qt** — use `qtbot` from pytest-qt and `mock_qsettings`. Patch
  `QFileDialog` / `QMessageBox` static methods at the call site, not at
  `PySide6.QtWidgets`.
- **E2e** — opt-in real-binary tests live in `tests/e2e/` behind
  `requires_*` markers. The synthetic-only e2e (no external binaries)
  lives in `tests/qt/test_synthetic_pipeline_e2e.py` and runs in CI.

## When making changes

- **Editing a `core/` resolver?** Run
  `py -m pytest tests/unit tests/integration` to verify the logic, then
  do a real scan against a profile to catch anything fixtures don't
  exercise.
- **Editing `cue4parse_cli/Program.cs`?** Rebuild (see above) and verify
  the **Unpacker** panel still mounts archives.
- **Editing `blender/*.py`?** These run inside Blender, not the venv —
  no PySide6, no project imports outside the `blender/` dir. Test by
  processing one asset end-to-end.
- **Editing the `texture_presets.json` schema?** Update both the
  resolver and any per-material overrides in user profiles. Bump
  `version` if the change is breaking.
- **Editing `config._DEFAULTS`?** Consider whether the new key belongs
  in `core/profile_manager.PROFILE_KEYS` instead — game-specific
  settings should be per-profile.
- **Don't touch `dist/` or `*.spec`** — both are generated by
  `build.bat`. The spec file is gitignored.
